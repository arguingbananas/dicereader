The original work was good and I'm trying to improve it for my needs. Specifically, I found that its accuracy improved when you could "zoom" in on the dice. So I implemented an approach that will automatically zoom in (in reality, crop image). Still experimenting, as all of this is still in a controlled environment as opposed to dice on craps table (for example :).
